* How to add CSS?
1. Inline CSS
        1. Use style inside tag.

2. Internal CSS
        1. use style tag in head tag. 
        2. Syntax
            <style>
            Selector 
            {
                property : value
            }
            </style>
        
        3. What if inline and internal both defines some properties?
        - Inline will win, but if you want internal to win just write !important;

        1. link css file in head.
        2. Do following in css file:
        Selector 
            {
                property : value
            }
            </style>

        }

    5. universal
            *{} - for everything

* Fonts & Colours
1. use font - : and u will see alot of properties like size,family etc.
            1. style: italic, bold, underline etc.
            2. size: in terms of pixel (1 physical pixel = 1/96 of an inch)
            3. family: you can apply times new roman etc
            4. weight: changes darkness/thickness of font

2. line-height: defines gap b/w 2 lines
3. fall back: use more than 1 font incase the first one does not applies.
4. import external fonts from google fonts.
            - copy link tag (will automaticzlly generate there.)

5. Colours: can use name, rgb, lsh or hexa considered
            - color: brown
            - color: rgba(20,1,192,0/1) -a decides transperancy level of Colours
            - color: you can pick any hex colour from color picker and paste (Eg, FFFFFF = WHITE where FF:R, FF:G, FF:B, FF:A)
            - color: hsl(20, 20%, 60%) you can pick any HCL color


* CSS BoxModel:
1. Border: border - style/width/color etc
                1. style: dotted or solid etc
2. Shortcut? border: style width color radis(roundness of border) 
3. <Span> tag is an inline element and as inline elements are occupied the with there sufficiency.Thats why this element not taking the width and height.
4. you can define width and height of your elements too.

5. BOX MODEL? verything is rendered on our website in box.

|                             |
|   +---------------------+   ← Border  
|   |                     |   |
|   |   +-------------+   |   |  
|   |   |             |  ← Padding: 
|                             |     1. you can increase padding like padding: 90px to have space b/w your content and border.  
|   |   |   Content   |   |   |     2. padding-left / padding-right / padding-top / padding - bottom   or padding: 20px 30px 20px 70px (top, right, left, bottom - acw) or padding: 20px 40px (topbottom and leftright)
|   |   |             |   |   |
