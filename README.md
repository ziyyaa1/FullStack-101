# 🧵 FullStack-101
A space to learn and practice FullStack Web Development — from notes to small projects.

## 🎨 What's inside

### Front-End
- `notes/` – scribbles, tips, and stuff to remember
- `projects/` – from basic projects to mini websites and UI clones
- `html/` – basic tags & structure
- `css/` – styling with vanilla CSS
- `flexbox/` & `grid/` – layout systems
- `bootstrap/` & `tailwind/` – frameworks for faster styling
- `js/` – JavaScript essentials
- `jquery/` – some old-school DOM magic

###  Back-End
- `unix/` – terminal & shell basics
- `nodejs/` – server-side JS
- `express/` – building APIs and web servers
- `api/` – working with REST & JSON
- `db/` – basic databases
- `sql/` & `postgresql/` – querying structured data

### Frameworks & Beyond
- `reactjs/` – modern front-end with components
- `dapp/` – decentralized apps 101
- `crypto-token/` – making your own token (just for fun)
- `nft-minting/` – like OpenSea but you

## 🍉 Goal
Learn full-stack without crying, build cool apps, and finally understand how the whole web works—from browser to backend and beyond.

## 🦾 Started this to:
- Keep all my full stack dev stuff in one place
- Track progress as I learn
- Practice practice & practice
- Help my dumb friend learn too (yk who you are)
