# ðŸ§µ HTML-101
A space to learn and practice HTML â€” from notes to small projects.

## What's inside
- `notes/` â€“ HTML tags, structure, tips
- `projects/` â€“ simple webpages and practice work
- `experiments/` â€“ trying out random things to learn by doing

## Goal
Learn HTML without crying, build cute pages, and understand how the web actually works.

##  Started this to:
- Keep all my HTML stuff in one place
- Track progress as I learn
- Practice without pressure
- Help my dumb friend learn too (yk who you are)
