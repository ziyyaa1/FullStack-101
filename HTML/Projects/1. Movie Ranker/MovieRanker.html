    <h1>My Bollywood Fav's</h1>

    <h2>1. Suspense / Thriller / Mystery</h2>
      <h3>Talaash</h3>
      <p>A broody, haunting mystery with layers of emotion and grief. Aamir Khan plays a cop with pain behind the badge. Must-watch for that slow-burn mystery thrill. </p>

      <h3>Drishyam</h3>
      <p>A mind-blowing thriller that keeps you hooked till the very end. Vijay Salgaonkar is THAT guy. Twists, suspense, emotion – it’s all there. Absolute must-watch, both parts! </p>

      <h3>Chor Nikal k Bhaga</h3>
      <p>High-stakes hijack + heist combo! Yami and Sunny deliver suspense, sass, and surprises. Just when you think you’ve figured it out — boom, another twist.</p>

      <h3>Dhoka</h3>
      <p>A lesser-known gem with major “trust no one” energy. It’s messy, dramatic, and keeps you second-guessing everyone. Chaos, betrayal, and a dark twist that makes you go “WAIT WHAT?</p>

    <h2>2. Horror</h2>
      <h3>Horror Story</h3>
      <p>A group of friends. An abandoned hotel. One wild night. Classic horror setup but with some solid creepy moments. Ghosts, screams, and a surprisingly good pace — a spooky little thrill ride!</p> </p>

      <h3>13B</h3>
      <p>A haunted TV that shows your future? Yup, that's 13B. Underrated but unforgettable horror!</p>

    <h2>3. Romance</h2>
     <h3>Veer-Zaara</h3>
     <p>As an all-time SRK fan, this one is one of my fav masterpiece of him. Pure, poetic, timeless love. Cross-border romance with soul and sacrifice. An emotional masterpiece that lives rent-free in my heart. </p>

     <h3>Shiddat</h3>
     <p>ntense, passionate, and sometimes chaotic — just like young love. Sunny Kaushal gives *major loverboy energy*. It’s dramatic, dreamy, and definitely a cry-a-little movie. </p>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRDjM6OAVwbA5T-v5YGoJ27e6bEvobP4c9vNQ&s" alt="Shiddat" width="250">

     <h3>Laila Majnu</h3>
     <p>Modern take on a legendary love story. Wild, poetic, and tragic AF. Imtiaz Ali's vibes, soulful music, and raw emotion — this one hits different. True hopeless romantic energy. </p>
      <img src="https://preview.redd.it/what-are-your-thoughts-on-laila-majnu-2018-v0-hyw0xe6imyya1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c398ee73deb659f46c39ffd57216d608e08b9ae0" alt="Laila Majnu" width="250">

     <h3>Okay Jaanu</h3>
     <p>Live-in, careers, and modern love dilemmas — but make it cute. Aditya + Shraddha’s chemistry is adorable, and AR Rahman’s music? Chef’s kiss. Light, sweet, and totally rewatchable. </p>
